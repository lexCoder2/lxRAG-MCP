Draw your floor plans on an interactive canvas, place columns, slabs, beams, and footings, then get code-compliant design calculations and a full 3D finite element analysis \u2014 all in the browser.\n\n## What It Does\n\n### Interactive Floor Plan Drawing\n\nThe central workspace is a 2D grid canvas where you design your building floor by floor.
